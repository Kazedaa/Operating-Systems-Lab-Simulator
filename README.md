## Introduction

The Virtual OS Lab Simulator is an educational tool designed to help users understand and visualize CPU Scheduling algorithms and InterProcess Communication (IPC) between web browser workers. It provides a graphical interface to experiment with various scheduling algorithms and observe how web workers communicate and share data.

## Features

- Simulation of various CPU Scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job Next (SJN)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin (RR)
- Visualization of CPU scheduling processes
- InterProcess Communication (IPC) between web browser workers
- User-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
